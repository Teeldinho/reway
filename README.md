# Reway Store

Reway Store is a feature-rich e-commerce application that highlights modern web technologies and best practices for product browsing, filtering, and user authentication. This project leverages the power of Next.js 14, Zustand, and nuqs for state management, ensuring a seamless and efficient user experience.

While many opt for traditional state managers, Reway Store demonstrates the powerful capabilities of using URLs as a state store, providing enhanced flexibility and performance through options like shallow routing and throttling.
